# reliable-data-transfer-over-udp

This program at the moment does not run.

Originally, I wrote this project as a school assignment, and it used a separate executable file called RELAY that would relay messages between Homeland and Embassy. The project
worked as intended and I received high marks (93 out of 100) on it. You can see the assignment_specifications.pdf and report.pdf files to understand the assignment as well as my program.

However, I was unable to upload the RELAY file to Github and have not yet figured out a good way of putting it on the web so that it can be used in this project by the public. It's
possible I will figure out how to do so, but in the meantime I have uploaded the homeland and embassy code files and relevant PDF files. Although the program does not run at the moment
(without the RELAY file), you can get a very clear picture of what the program does by perusing the files provided.

The assignment_specifications.pdf file is a description of the assignment written by my professors. The report.pdf file is a summary of my solution written by me. The homeland and embassy
python files were also written by me. Enjoy.
